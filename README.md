# Library of Lua scripts for use with Foldit

The repository was created to allow for enhanced version control of Foldit scripts. Most of the scripts in this collection were written by other Foldit users. Many of these have been modified signigicantly for personal use as a means of learning Lua and understanding its use within Foldit.

Typical modifications include some combination of:
- renaming of variables to more meaningful, intuitive names
- adhering to a consistent variable-naming system across different scripts
- standardizing common functions across scripts
- refactoring code, in some cases, to increase efficiency and/or reduce redundency
- adding/enhancing functionality/features
- cosmetic changes to spacing around operators, etc.

Original scripts are largely utilitarian and/or experimental. Some are only useful as a tool to learn and understand how to work with Lua scripts within the Foldit environment. Some are purely to satisfy a particular curiousity. There is a lot of subjectivity within these changes. Therefore, it feels appropriate to utilize GitHub as means to track all changes to the code.
